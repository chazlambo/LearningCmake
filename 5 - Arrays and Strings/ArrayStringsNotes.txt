Arrays and Strings

Important Points
	-Array vs Single Variable
	-Characters
	-Strings
	-Type Alias
	-Coding Style
		-Code has to be readable by humans
		-Avoid global variables
		-Indentation

Arrays
	int numbers[256];		// Create fixed size array of 256 elements
	using Array = int[256];	// Alias array of 256 as Array
	Array numbers;			// same as int numbers[256] after aliasing array

Characters
	ASCII: 8 bits to represent character, 256 possible symbols
	We now use Unicode which allows many more characters
		Also much more complex, commonly encoded as UTF-8
	Use single quotes fro characters, double quotes are for strings

Strings and Inputs
	std:: string: simplifies dealing with sequences of characters
		Resizing, finding characters, etc.
	Input: We can use std::cin to read input from the console
		Can read input separated by any whitespace (space, newline, tab)(e.g. word by word)
		Can also read input separated just by newlines (e.e., line by line)
		Can also read input separated by arbitrary characters(commas, etc.)

STL vector, aka std::vector
	A std::vector is a sequence of elements of hte same type where the type is written in carrots <,> for example: std::vector<int> is a sequence of ints
	Need to #include<vector>
