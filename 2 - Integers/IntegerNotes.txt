bits: single value
	-Either 0 or 1
byte: collection of 8 bits

Number: an ordered collection of bits
	- Decimal: Base 10
		-10 digits, 0-9
		-Each column 10x bigger
	- Binary: Base 2
		-2 digits, 0-1
		-Each column 2x bigger
	- Hexadecimal: Base 16

Negative Integers: 
	One's Complement: Flip 0's and 1's
	Two's Complement: One's Complement + 1
		a = 5
		a -> 0101
		One's Complement: 1010
		Two's Complement: 1011
		--> (-5) = 1011
		Note: This is reversible!

int: 32-bit complement signed integers
	- (-2^31 to 2^31 -1)
	- Most common type

unsigned int - 32-bit unsigned integer
	- (0 to 2^32 -1)

short: 16 bit int

long: in practice same as int
	- Compiler dependent (AVOID)
	- 64 bits on 64-bit machines
	- 32 bits on 32-bit machines

long long: 64 bit int
	- (-2^63 to 2^63 -1)

unsigned long long: 64 bit unsigned int
	- (0 to 2^64 -1)

size_t: unsigned type to represent sizes of things in bytes
	- 64 bits on 64-bit machines
	- 32 bits on 32-bit machines

C++11 adds the following:
(Use these if you need since htey make it clear how many bits are used)
-int8_t
-int16_t
-int32_t
-int64_t
-uint8_t
-uint16_t
-etc...
