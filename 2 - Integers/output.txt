Note the overflow

n = -32768
n / -2 = 16384
n / -1 = -32768
Note that even division can cause overflow(2000'000'000 + 2000'000'000) / 2 = -147483648
Note that both are signed int which can hold 2 billion but not 4 billion so overflow occurs before division
(2000'000'0000 + 2000'000'000) / 2 =11000000000
(2000'000'000 + 2000'000'0000) / 2 =11000000000
